A simpleÂ  **Choose Your Own Adventure Game** created using python.

Currently there are **2** winning solutions, but I plan to add many more questions and winning solutions over time.

# Requirements

# Run in GitPod

You can also run **Choose Your Own Adventure Game**  in Gitpod, a free online dev environment for GitHub.

Please make a **PR** if you want to add a **question, fix grammar/typos, etc.** (will add **CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINES soon**).

Thanks,
